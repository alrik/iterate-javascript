description: |
  A handy function with a **unified interface** to iterate Strings, Arrays, TypedArrays, Maps, Sets, (any Iterables) & Objects.
  The api is oriented on [Array.prototype.forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach)
  with the advantage of **iterating almost everything** and **iteration skipping**.
